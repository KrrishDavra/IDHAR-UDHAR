            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">Packaging Instructions:</h3>
            <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Cover the goods completely, securing the ends with tape.</li>
              <li>For fragile items, use bubble wrap ensuring corners and edges are well protected.</li>
              <li>Use stretch wrap to keep items snugly in place.</li>
              <li>Fill voids in boxes with crumpled paper; use cushioning at the bottom for fragile goods.</li>
              <li>Use strong shipping tape (e.g., pressure-sensitive or water-activated tape).</li>
              <li>Do not use string instead of tape.</li>
            </ol>
            <p className="mt-2">
              The Consignor understands that using <strong>Idhar Udhar</strong>'s services for sending fragile items is at the Consignor's own risk. If the consignment includes fragile or high-risk items, please ensure packaging is done carefully as stated. <strong>Idhar Udhar</strong> shall not be liable for any damage due to poor packaging.
            </p>

            <p>The Consignor warrants that they are the owner or authorized agent of the owner of the goods transported and are authorized to accept these terms and conditions.</p>
            <p>The Consignor is required to accurately fill all consignment and trip details into the mobile app when booking. These details constitute the 'Goods Forwarding Note'.</p>
            <p><strong>Idhar Udhar</strong> shall, upon receipt of the Goods Forwarding Note, issue a Goods Receipt/Consignment Note to the Consignor.</p>
            <p>The Consignor is responsible for all goods transported through <strong>Idhar Udhar</strong>, will only use its services for legal purposes, and guarantees that the consignment matches its description in the application and is not a Prohibited Item. If otherwise, the Consignor agrees to fully indemnify <strong>Idhar Udhar</strong> and/or its agents for any related liabilities or losses.</p>
            <p>All consignments are accepted on a "said-to-contain" basis, meaning <strong>Idhar Udhar</strong> has no obligation to verify contents. The Consignor must declare the accurate description and value of the consignment.</p>
            <p>At the time of booking, the Consignor must provide a declaration of the consignment's value and description, which will be binding.</p>
            <p><strong>Idhar Udhar</strong> may use information shared by the Consignor and consignee to send updates via SMS, WhatsApp, email, or other agreed means. It may also analyze user behavior in the app for internal and marketing purposes. The Consignor agrees to this use.</p>
            <p>Consignors agree to indemnify and hold <strong>Idhar Udhar</strong> and its agents harmless for any liabilities due to their acts, omissions, legal breaches, or third-party claims.</p>

            <p>The Consignor must ensure the consignee is available at the delivery time. If not, the item may be returned, stored, or disposed of. RTO consignments may attract storage charges if the Consignor is unavailable.</p>
            <p><strong>Idhar Udhar</strong> does not deliver to PO boxes. Delivery is to the consignee's address—not necessarily the consignee personally. Addresses with central receiving areas will be delivered to those areas only. No doorstep delivery is offered.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">LOAD ASSIST SERVICES</h3>

In the event of failure by the Consignor, the Consignor shall be solely liable for any repercussions for non-compliance under applicable Law. <strong>Idhar Udhar</strong> shall not be responsible for actions of the authorities due to misdeclaration, the Consignor will have to deal directly with all tax and statutory authorities in case of any notices related to the e-waybill from any tax / statutory authorities.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">LIEN AND UNDELIVERED GOODS</h3>
            <p>Notwithstanding any other remedy available to <strong>Idhar Udhar</strong>, <strong>Idhar Udhar</strong> shall have a lien over all goods/consignments in its possession or under its control in respect of any sums due to <strong>Idhar Udhar</strong> by the Consignor. Notwithstanding that <strong>Idhar Udhar</strong> shall have a lien over any goods/consignments, the Consignor shall continue to be liable for any and all charges arising from the provision of the Services until all sums due to <strong>Idhar Udhar</strong> have been received by it. If the consignee does not take delivery of the consignment or it remains undelivered due to any reason such as wrong or incomplete address or refusal by consignee to pay any applicable duties/taxes/charges or containing Prohibited Items or if the packaging of a consignment is damaged to the extent that repacking is not possible resulting in non-delivery or the consignment is found as likely to cause damage to other goods or cause injury to individuals, then the Consignor shall still be liable to pay freight charges and all other dues and charges to <strong>Idhar Udhar</strong>. In case the goods remain undelivered beyond 48 (forty-eight) hours from the date of tendering the consignment for delivery, then demurrage/warehouse charges at such other rates as may be fixed by <strong>Idhar Udhar</strong> from time to time. Further, if the consignment is not received or claimed within 7 days from the date of tendering the consignment for delivery for the first time, then <strong>Idhar Udhar</strong> shall have the right to proceed with the sale of the goods of the consignment to realize all its dues. <strong>Idhar Udhar</strong> reserves the right to levy suitable demurrage/incidental charges for extended storage of such goods.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS</h3>
            <p>Enterprise customers who avail <strong>Idhar Udhar</strong>'s services through API integration shall also be subject to these <strong>Idhar Udhar</strong> terms and conditions.</p>
